Plugin modules for KlarkJS

We are trying to create an ecosystem of utilities and functionalities that improve dramatically the automation of creating a robust API in NodeJS and [KlarkJS](https://github.com/apostolidhs/klark-js).

The main architecture that came up when we integrate a NodeJS API is the following:

1. Receive request
2. Check permitions
3. Check Parameters
4. Execute the controller
5. Response

Our requirements for every section are somehow straight forward
